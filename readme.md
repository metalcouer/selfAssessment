-30 min at home minimum daily mon-sun
-smoke only after the day is done



3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**
-how to write conditionals correctly in order to execute functions.



4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**
APIâ€™s and fetch requests. Dom manipulation makes sense and is helping previous functions lessons connect better in my brain. Happy that i can read a piece or logic and understand/interpret what the code is actually saying. Also github!!

AR!!!! I think the future is heading that way and the possibilities are endless when it comes to what we can do with AR in gaming/healthcare/travel industries. Also, BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTIRIES BABY $$$
